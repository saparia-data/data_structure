'''
Given an integer x. The task is to find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(√x).

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, the only line contains the number x.

Output:
For each testcase, print square root of given integer.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function floorSqrt() which should return the square root of given number x.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ x ≤ 107

Example:
Input:
2
5
4
Output:
2
2

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Since, 5 is not perfect square, so floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
Testcase 2: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.

hints:

1) Start with ‘start’ = 0, end = ‘x’,
2) Do following while ‘start’ is smaller than or equal to ‘end’.
      a) Compute ‘mid’ as (start + end)/2
      b) compare mid*mid with x.
      c) If x is equal to mid*mid, return mid.
      d) If x is greater, do binary search between mid+1 and end. In this case, we also update ans (Note that we need floor).
      e) If x is smaller, do binary search between start and mid
