'''
Given a number 'N'. The task is to find the Nth number whose each digit is a prime number i.e 2, 3, 5, 7. 
In other words, you have to find the nth number of this sequence: 2, 3, 5, 7, 22, 23,.. and so on.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer T i.e. the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case consists of an integer N. 

Output: 
In one line print the nth number of the given sequence made of prime digits.

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100

Examples:
Input:
2
10
21
Output:
33
222

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 10th number in the sequence of numbers whose each digit is prime is 33.
Testcase 2: 21st number in the sequence of numbers whose each digit is prime is 222.
