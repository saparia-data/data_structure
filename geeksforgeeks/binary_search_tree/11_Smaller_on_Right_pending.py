Given an array arr[] of N elements. The task is to count maximum number of distinct smaller elements on right side of any array element. 
For example, in {10, 6, 9, 7, 20, 19, 21, 18, 17, 16}, the result is 4.  Note that 20 has maximum 4 smaller elements on right side. 
Other elements have less count, for example 10 has 3 smaller elements on right side.
